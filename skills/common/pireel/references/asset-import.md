# Asset Import — local video into Pireel

When the user gives a local video path ("把 ~/Desktop/talk.mp4 剪一下"), do NOT tell them to open the browser and upload manually — import it yourself with the bundled helper script, then edit through the normal Pireel tools.

## Where the bytes go (transfer matrix)

This is the authoritative statement — tool descriptions and other references must not contradict it.

| Asset | Transfer |
|---|---|
| **Main video** | **localhost → the OPEN Studio tab, over the user's machine — NOT uploaded to the cloud** (fast even for big files) |
| Transcription audio | a small AAC is uploaded to the cloud (Pireel's transcription needs a URL it can fetch) |
| B-roll (`--broll`) | uploaded to the cloud (`insert_clip` fetches it later, possibly in another session) |
| Images | uploaded to the cloud asset library, or inlined as a data URI |

**Because the main video streams straight into the browser, a Studio tab MUST be open before you import it.** If none is, the helper exits with `studio_not_open` — open one (call `create_browser_handoff` and open the URL in your own in-app browser, or ask the user to open the project) and re-run the helper. There is no cloud fallback for the main video.

## Two ways in (both keep the video local)

**A. The helper — PRIMARY.** Runs a throwaway localhost server and hands the bytes to the open tab via `register-local`; the tab fetches them over loopback (verified working, including in restricted in-app browsers — every response carries a Content-Type). Works with ANY browser hosting the tab (the user's own Chrome or an agent-driven one) and needs no browser-driving ability from you: one command imports, probes metadata, transcribes, and registers the project. Details below.

**B. Direct injection (fallback — when the helper can't run, and you drive the browser yourself).** No import token, no helper. With the studio tab open, set the file on the studio's always-present hidden input — Playwright is exposed as `tab.playwright`:

```js
await tab.playwright.setInputFiles('[data-pireel-video-input]', '/absolute/path/to/video.mp4');
```

The studio reads the file locally into its OPFS library and makes it the main video — nothing is uploaded. Then transcribe with the `extract_asr` MCP tool (it runs in the tab; note this route skips the helper's ffprobe/transcript step). If `setInputFiles` isn't available, catch the file chooser instead: `tab.playwright.waitForEvent('filechooser')` then `chooser.setFiles(path)` around a click on the input.

## The helper

`../scripts/import-media.mjs` (relative to this reference — the `pireel` skill's `scripts/` dir). Node ≥ 20, zero npm dependencies. For a main video it:

1. Computes the content signature (`name:size:mtime` — the same fingerprint the browser uses, so the same file is one object however it enters).
2. Starts a throwaway `127.0.0.1` HTTP server and, via `register-local`, hands the bytes to the open Studio tab — the browser fetches them over loopback straight into its local library (OPFS). The video never touches the cloud. If no tab is open it stops here and asks you to open one and retry.
3. If `ffprobe` is available: probes duration/width/height and the audio-track start offset.
4. If `ffmpeg` is available and the file has audio: extracts a small AAC track, uploads ONLY that audio to the cloud, and runs Pireel's transcription — the transcript lands on the project immediately.
5. Registers everything on a project (server-side, conservative targeting) and prints a JSON summary.

Full flow: open a tab if none is → `import_media` (no args, MCP) → token → run helper with `--token` → read the JSON → `get_state`.

```bash
node <pireel-skill-dir>/scripts/import-media.mjs --token <import-token> /path/to/video.mp4
# options: --base https://pireel.com · --ffmpeg/--ffprobe <path> · --no-transcribe
```

**Run the helper OUT of sandbox by default** — it needs the user's local file paths and network access to the Pireel endpoint; request approval instead of attempting a sandboxed run first. A sandboxed `connection refused` does not mean the server is down.

Auth — no user action needed: call the `import_media` MCP tool **with no arguments** first; it returns a short-lived (30 min) import `token`. Pass that to the helper via `--token`. Never pass OAuth tokens to shell commands.

## ffmpeg / ffprobe

Resolution order: `--ffmpeg`/`--ffprobe` flags → `FFMPEG_PATH`/`FFPROBE_PATH` env → `PATH`.

**If they are missing, install them yourself** — do not bounce this to the user as a question. The host's own command-approval flow is the user's consent surface:

- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Windows: `winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg` (then re-open the terminal for PATH)
- Linux: `apt-get install -y ffmpeg` / the distro equivalent

If the package manager itself is unavailable or the install command is denied, THEN fall back to a degraded import and tell the user what was skipped. Capability tiers:

- **Both available**: full import — duration/dims registered, transcript ready; transcript-based offline editing (read_script / cut_narration / plan_brief / set_captions) works immediately, before any browser is opened.
- **ffprobe only**: metadata registered, no transcript. Transcription happens later in the browser (`extract_asr`).
- **Neither**: the video still streams into the open tab and registers; only metadata/transcript are deferred (the browser completes dimensions on load, and `extract_asr` produces the transcript later). Nothing is lost, just deferred.

## Images

Two routes, picked by what the deployment has — the goal is the user's local image (logo, product shot, screenshot) ending up inside a composed block (`<img src="...">` in the compose_block_brief → apply_block flow).

**Small images (≲ 500KB): inline as a data URI — fully local, zero storage.** You write the block HTML yourself in the BYO flow, so read the file, base64 it, and embed `<img src="data:image/png;base64,...">` directly. No upload, works on every deployment including self-hosted with no storage. Constraint: the whole apply_block payload must stay under ~1MB (bridge message cap), and inlined images bloat the saved project — keep them small (compress/resize first if ffmpeg is around).

**Larger images: upload to the asset library via the same helper.** Image paths (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.webp`/`.gif`, ≤ 30MB) passed alongside videos are uploaded and registered; mixed invocations work: `node import-media.mjs --token … video.mp4 logo.png`.

- `url_kind: "public"` — a stable public/CDN link came back: safe to bake into blocks. (Hosted pireel.com always does this.)
- `url_kind: "none"` — the deployment has storage but no public media base: the bytes are stored and visible in the asset library, but there is no stable URL to bake into blocks. Fall back to the data-URI route for the block itself, or tell the user to configure a public media base.

## B-roll (insert a clip into the timeline)

To add a local video as a SEGMENT of the current project (not as its main footage), upload with `--broll`:

```
node import-media.mjs --token … --broll /path/to/broll.mp4
```

This uploads bytes only (no transcription, no project registration) and prints a `sig`. Then call the `insert_clip` MCP tool with `{sig, atSec?}` — it needs the studio tab open (video bytes live in the browser). The clip snaps to the nearest shot boundary, later overlays shift right, and it is a full peer afterwards: framing, captions, matting, its own audio, and on-demand transcription all apply. A video already in the user's library (e.g. a generated one) can be inserted directly via `insert_clip {url}` — external URLs are rejected, upload those first.

## Project targeting

`import_media` is conservative: a project that already has footage (shots/blocks) and a DIFFERENT video is never clobbered — a new project is created automatically, titled after the filename. The latest project is reused only when it is empty or already uses this exact video. The tool result tells you which happened (`reused: true/false`, `projectId`, `title`).

## After import

- Call `get_state` — the new/updated project is now the latest, so offline tools target it.
- If a transcript was registered (`transcript > 0` in the helper output), go straight to transcript work: `read_script`, cleanup via the talking-head-cleanup skill, `plan_brief` → `submit_plan`.
- The tab was already open for the import (that's how the bytes got in), so the live bridge is connected — storyboarding (`lay_out`), visual analysis, and Pireel-side generation are all available. If the user later reopens the project on a DIFFERENT device (where the local bytes aren't cached), the video won't auto-return — they re-pick the file. Cross-device video persistence is a deliberate non-goal of this path.

## When NOT to use the helper

- The file is already in the project (check `get_state` — same video sig means re-import is a no-op anyway).
- The user is already in the studio tab and can just drag the file in themselves.
- Upload is denied by host policy: stop, explain, and ask the user to upload in the studio tab instead. Do not work around a denial.

## Limits

Single file ≤ 2 GB. Larger sources: ask the user to trim/transcode first (with their consent, ffmpeg can do it locally) or upload via browser.
