# Executable Distribution

Read this to locate, install, or update the executable Hypit Distribution after installing the Skill.

## Keep three lifecycles separate

The installed Skill supplies production judgment. The executable Distribution supplies `hypit`,
`hypit studio`, official packages, and Runtime hosts. A video project supplies the work's Sources,
Runs, assets, local packages, Profile selection, and Results. They can live in unrelated locations
and none is installed as a side effect of another. `npx skills add hypit-ai/hypit -g` installs the
Skill's knowledge; the executable is the separate npm package `@hypit/hypit`.

Work from the capabilities of the current Agent environment: project-file access, command execution,
service connectivity and a way to return previews or media to the user. A browser interface can
control a remote execution environment; its files, processes and localhost addresses belong there.
Use the environment's available preview forwarding or file delivery, and retain the project and
accepted material in storage that lasts beyond a disposable session. Reading the Skill establishes
available knowledge; the actual tools and locations establish what can run.

## Find the installation already available

An available launcher can identify its version and physical locations:

```bash
hypit --version
hypit version
hypit --help
hypit paths
```

`version` identifies the executing Distribution and launcher without opening a project or Runtime.
`paths` includes the active Distribution, project, and host locations. A missing Runtime Profile is
a separate setup question from whether the executable is installed.

If the shell cannot find `hypit`, inspect the project's and npm's global package records:

```bash
npm ls @hypit/hypit --depth=0
npm ls --global @hypit/hypit --depth=0
npm prefix --global
```

A project installation can run through `npm exec --no -- hypit --version` and
`npm exec --no -- hypit paths`; `--no` declines npm's offer to install a missing package. A global
installation may need its executable directory added to the current shell's PATH: `<prefix>/bin`
on POSIX systems, or the prefix itself on Windows. Use the existing installation or its known
launcher, and retain the working command and location in project notes when useful for resuming.

## Install the executable package

The usual machine-wide installation command for a published release is:

```bash
npm install --global @hypit/hypit
```

A project can instead keep Hypit in its own dependencies and lockfile:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @hypit/hypit
npm exec --no -- hypit --help
```

Use the release version selected by the user or project when one is specified. If the selected
registry reports a missing package or version, that release is unavailable there. An official release
supplied as a tarball can be installed directly, for example
`npm install --global /path/to/hypit-release.tgz`. Report the actual installation error when the
release cannot be obtained.

If installation is slow or a registry mirror lacks the selected release, use
[network preparation](local-tools.md#make-network-preparation-practical) to inspect the actual download
source and choose a reachable route. Keep the requested version when changing registries.

## Let the installation channel own updates

The Distribution supplies local execution and HypiHub Providers, plus public SDKs and examples for
project extensions. A service the user brings can use an installed or project-authored Provider;
its absence from the official bundle is an extension question. Follow
[Models and Providers](model-and-provider.md) for that connection. Installing the executable does
not choose a service account or prepare every model that a production might eventually use.

Install, update, and remove the Distribution through the same package or release channel. Updating
it does not update an installed Skill or edit a video project. Updating the Skill does not replace the
executable Distribution. After installation or an update, use the selected launcher for `--version`,
`--help`, and `paths`, then continue with
`profile.md` for the current project's capabilities and Runtime choices.

The installed Distribution is the authority for exact Surface syntax. If a package or Surface named
by the Skill is absent from `hypit vocabulary`, check package selection and the installed release.
Explain whether the work needs an available package, a supported alternative or a Distribution update.

## Check and update the relevant installation

Use the installed version and release information to understand available capabilities or a reported
fix. The active launcher above identifies what is running. Check the latest published executable
without installing anything:

```bash
hypit version --check
```

This reads npm's public registry and prints the source and release-notes link. Use `--registry <url>`
with `--check` for a chosen mirror, or `--json` for structured output. A different version can mean
a newer local checkout or a stale mirror; a failed query leaves the remote version unknown. Neither
observation changes the project or starts an upgrade. Ordinary `hypit version` and `--version` stay
local. For an older executable without this command, the existing package-manager query still works:

```bash
npm view @hypit/hypit@latest version
```

`npm view` reads the configured npm registry; a stale mirror or failed query leaves the upstream version
uncertain. The [Hypit releases](https://github.com/hypit-ai/hypit/releases) explain published changes.
Tell the user which change matters to this work and which installation needs it. Updating follows
the selected installation method above, respecting the project's chosen version and lockfile.

An installed Skill has its own source and installation scope. For the
[skills installer](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#skills-update), inspect its current help and
installed records (`npx skills list -g` for the global scope). When updating a globally installed
Hypit Skill, use a targeted update:

```bash
npx skills update hypit -g
```

This changes that installed Skill; it is not a read-only check. Use the scope and
options supported by the actual installer. A different installer or explicitly selected checkout
uses its own update method. Updating Hypit need not update unrelated skills or project dependencies.
Read the updated Skill from the installation the Agent uses; an already loaded instruction can
still reflect its earlier contents. Report what was updated and what remains unchanged or unknown.

## Project changes and execution code

A contributor checkout can execute its own Distribution after its documented workspace setup, but it
is a development arrangement, not an assumed location for ordinary production. Use one only when the
user explicitly supplied or selected that checkout.

Optional upstream npm tools live under the Host package home reported by `paths`, with one installation
per exact package version. Separate Distribution requirements can coexist there, while npm still shares
its download cache. `hypit packages install <package@version>` reports `install.log`; inspect that file
when a download appears stalled or fails. Installing an upstream tool does not start a service or
restart an existing service. Project component edits are loaded by the next Build. See
[Build execution](../production/builds.md#build-with-the-current-project-implementation) for Distribution
bootstrap changes and service lifetimes.
