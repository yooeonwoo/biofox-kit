# Directing generated video

Read this before writing or adapting a video prompt, performance Recipe or action. An image can
establish who and where; generated video brings the Script and visual idea to life through speech,
interaction, camera behavior or silent action.

For creator-led social video, favor an appealing, engaged performance: the speaker responds to what
they are saying and draws someone into the thought. Voice, expression and movement carry that
relationship together. Expressiveness concerns how clearly the attitude comes through; it can be
outgoing or restrained.

## Direct the reason for an action

Give the passage a clear expressive intention, then specify the few details that decide how it
lands. Start with how the speaker regards the subject and relates to the listener: eagerly sharing
a discovery with a friend, weighing an ambitious claim with skeptical interest, or affectionately
roasting something they know well. Such directions suggest voice, expression, posture and rhythm
together. Their value is the performable relationship they contain.

As with [Image direction](image-direction.md#compress-the-idea-into-decisive-anchors), high-level
language should carry sensory direction. The model can realize "admiring but incredulous" across a
whole passage. Words such as "lively" or "expressive" set an energy level; the speaker's particular
response to the meaning gives that energy direction. Locate the consequential thought in the Script
and make its expression concrete: what earns an accent, changes the face, or moves the body?
Voice, expression and gesture can reinforce one response, with whichever channels make it legible.
A single revealing reaction can carry the thought; specifying all channels at every phrase adds no
inherent value.

For example, alongside a Script that questions a price and ends with an ironic compliment:

```text
She is venting to a friend with affectionate exasperation at how overpriced this is. At the price,
her eyebrows rise and her open palm turns upward with an incredulous vocal accent. Let the final
compliment land with a teasing smile in her voice.
```

The first sentence directs the entire encounter. The details make the price and the ironic turn
read clearly; the remaining phrasing and movement can grow naturally from that attitude. A detail
earns its place when it clarifies a judgment, reveals a response or preserves an important physical
relationship. Attaching a hand movement to every phrase adds choreography without necessarily
strengthening the expression.

Let the thought determine whether the attitude develops or holds: an example may win a skeptical
speaker over, while a firm argument may sustain the same conviction throughout. When adapting a
reference, recover what prompts the reaction and how it lands, then find the corresponding thought
in the new Script. This preserves the expressive relationship while letting the new words call for
their own movements and phrasing. Phrase-level emphasis should fit the performed language's tones
and cadence; a source-language stress pattern is not a universal performance instruction.

Carry the character, voice and useful physical relationships across Takes while directing the
attitude each passage calls for. The same speaker can invite, question, tease and persuade as the
argument develops. Shared direction can preserve their manner; the passage supplies the particular
response. Carry forward production continuity, and reconsider the expressive intention whenever the
thought changes. Stable framing leaves room for changes in face, voice and posture.

## Give restraint an expressive purpose

Seriousness can mean weighing a claim, insisting on a fact or challenging an assumption. A relaxed
person can tease, dismiss or show interest with very little effort. Choose the behavior that conveys
that attitude. A small, deliberate response can carry more conviction than constant movement.

For a serious judgment:

```text
She weighs the claim with skeptical interest. Her brow tightens at the price; she gives the number
a pointed emphasis, then lands her judgment with a small, decisive nod.
```

For a languid response:

```text
He lounges back in the chair, amused that anyone finds this impressive. He draws out the setup
with a sideways glance, then tosses off the verdict in a light, dismissive tone.
```

These are different intentions, not prescribed poses for every serious or relaxed person. Breathing,
blinking and small posture adjustments supply ordinary life; the speaker's response to the content
supplies the performance. Direct that response even when the body stays almost still.

Contrast describes a relationship between things; it leaves the performer's attitude unspecified.
Turn the chosen relationship into something the person can express: "She tries to sound composed,
but cannot quite hide her pride in the result" gives voice and expression a shared direction.
Humor reaches the viewer through the words, situation, response or delivery. A straight-faced
performance can sharpen a clear joke through pointed emphasis or a dry turn of phrase; an unusual
appearance alone does not make an even explanation funny. [Treatment](../../creation/brief.md#treatment-is-the-directors-answer)
owns how the premise becomes a viewer experience; action directs the person's part in creating it.

## Ground actions in the generated scene

The prompt describes what this generation should make visible over time. Give a performer physical
relationships with the camera, people, props and parts of the setting that actually exist in the
generated scene. Translate a later graphic's framing needs into the camera view, gaze or gesture
the video should perform. Give the later Caption, icon or product card its own content and events
through composition. A prop or display intended to exist within the generated scene can be described
as that actual object and connected through the relevant references.

The spoken subject and the visible action have separate responsibilities. A speaker can discuss
objects, quantities, transformations or an imaginary demonstration while the camera records only
their performance in the referenced setting. Preserve the words in Dialogue; use action to describe
the person's response to those words. A quoted phrase can locate a vocal accent or a hand beat
without asking for its meaning to appear as an object, written label or event in the shot.

Make the performer the subject of the direction. "She gives the promise a satisfied accent and a
small nod" identifies what the camera and microphone should capture. "Make the idea tangible" or
"show that it works" leaves the means of demonstration open. Complete that translation into the
intended voice, expression or physical interaction before writing the request. Read the assembled
prompt as one account of the generated scene; a general no-text instruction does not resolve an
ambiguous invitation to demonstrate the spoken content visually.

Capable video models can turn figurative wording into literal objects, events or transformations. Use
concrete visible language for intended gaze, gesture, movement, camera behavior and cuts when a
metaphor would introduce the wrong scene content. Social attitude and aesthetic shorthand remain
useful when they direct performance; an imagined object or event belongs in the prompt when it should
truly appear in the generated world.

Give the performer an attitude they can express, such as questioning a claim with skeptical interest.
The broader purpose of persuading an audience belongs in Treatment; translate it into this person's
delivery and interaction. Decide whether a described action really happens or whether a gesture is
intended, then state that choice. [Direction and its inputs](../../production/system.md#give-each-part-the-direction-it-can-realize)
connects those performance choices to the whole composition.

Natural emphatic gestures are usually more reliable than asking fingers to display an exact number.
Let speech, Caption or MG convey the quantity while pointing and hand actions serve the performance.
An encounter also has edges: someone interrupted can first be occupied, and someone finishing can
begin to leave. Small causes make a clip feel like a piece of life rather than a pose bounded by the
encoder.

## Give each input its own responsibility

| Input | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Character-and-scene references | appearance, setting, framing and the physical state to preserve |
| Product, interface or other factual references | the visible facts that need continuity or exactness |
| Motion or camera video references | temporal behavior whose phrasing, coordination or path should guide the new shot |
| Recurring voice references | a speaker's intended voice identity when the model accepts them |
| Script dialogue | the exact words, intended pronunciation and speaking turns for a visible performance |
| Prompt Kit or Recipe | a reusable prompt relationship that fits this kind of work |
| Passage direction | attitude, vocal delivery, attention, physical interaction, camera behavior and motivated cuts |

Keep those responsibilities explicit in Source. Prompt prose does not create a media edge, and a
reference does not explain which fact it should preserve. A selected model may accept only some of
these inputs; use its installed vocabulary and package-local documentation for the exact request.

For a visible A-roll performance, the generated video normally carries the person's picture, exact
Script delivery and sound together. Give the request the useful camera image, the recurring Voice
Reference when supported, and the Segment's dialogue.
[Voice direction](voice-direction.md) owns the casting and sample that establish who the person sounds
like. The passage's direction gives that voice its current attitude and delivery.
[Script pronunciation](../../creation/script-and-time.md#write-the-intended-pronunciation) explains
how names and abbreviations receive the intended reading while keeping their display spelling.
Independent speech is a different A-roll construction, described in
[Voice and performance](voice-and-performance.md).

For silent B-roll, direct the visual event and omit speaking identity that the shot does not use. A
listener or reaction shot can remain silent while still breathing, noticing, adjusting posture or
responding through expression. [B-roll](b-roll.md) owns its editorial relationship to the underlying
performance.

## Choose the generation relationship

Seedance 2 Mini at 720p is the usual starting point for generated performances, balancing capability
and cost. Choose for the intended shot and the user's available services; the selected model's
installed vocabulary owns supported resolutions, references and request lengths.

Generated-video models commonly expose some combination of three relationships:

| Relationship | When it fits |
| --- | --- |
| Text-directed video | The intended world and action do not depend on an existing visual identity, composition or motion reference. |
| First-/last-frame video | The shot must begin or end at a particular authored image. |
| Reference-directed video | Images, video or audio should guide identity, world, voice, motion or camera language without declaring literal endpoints. |

Reference-directed generation is the strong starting point for controlled Hypit production because
useful images can already establish people, scenes, products, composition and visual continuity. The
requested performance then makes that world move. Text-directed or first-/last-frame generation remains
useful when its relationship is genuinely the one the shot needs; a last frame belongs when arriving
at that exact image is part of the intended action.

Model-specific Surfaces and Prompt Kits are implementations of these relationships, not the Craft
itself. Kits produce ordinary Text; Source connects that Text and the actual references to the selected
model request. The current Distribution may provide model-specific Kit packages such as
`@hypit/seedance-kits`; their package documentation owns exact imports, slots, Recipe choices and
reference order. [Prompt Kits](../../production/prompt-kits.md) explains using or authoring a Kit
without making it a model wrapper.

Read the selected template's wording when choosing its Recipe. Composition, camera, edit rhythm,
performance and gesture choices shape different aspects of the footage. Choose them to support the
intended delivery, and use action Text for the passage's particular meaning and reactions.

## Let footage carry motion that matters

When the defining value of a reference is its movement, let a video reference carry that evidence to
an appropriate video model. Dance phrasing, coordinated body action and a distinctive camera move
can be easier to preserve through footage than through a long verbal reconstruction. Understand what
makes the movement work, then state which motion to follow and which person, setting or appearance
to change. The reference supplies temporal behavior; the prompt and other references direct the new
visible result.

Choose a useful excerpt around the complete action and its preparation or settling. Size it using
the source passage, the target's intended duration and the selected model's actual reference-duration,
count and size limits. A long reference can yield several purposeful excerpts. Preserve continuous
action where it matters, and use natural editorial boundaries where separate requests make sense.
Connect the actual video as a reference input; an excerpt mentioned only in prose is not an input.

The same [reference relationships](generated-dependencies.md) apply: each image, video or audio carries
specific facts, and the nearest useful references guide the next request. Image references can supply
the target identity or world while video supplies movement. The selected model and Provider determine
which combination is supported. Read their installed vocabulary and exact media requirements,
including any declared person-reference metadata, before submitting. Motion reference is another
way to direct capable generation, alongside text, camera images and voice references.

## Direct camera and cuts as part of the passage

For ordinary direct-to-camera social video, prefer pause-trim jump cuts at phrase boundaries. This
edited rhythm keeps the explanation moving and gives the footage the immediacy of a creator's own
cut-down recording. Stable framing, expressive acting and frequent edits are compatible choices.
Use the selected Kit's documented Recipe choice to express that rhythm.

A podcast can cut with a speaker or toward a meaningful reaction. A street interview can favor the
guest and use the interviewer view for a reaction. An unfolding action or a held reaction may gain
its effect from a continuous shot; choose that temporal shape when it serves the passage.

One generated video can contain multiple shots, several speaking turns or a split-screen composition.
One Segment is not one speaker turn or one camera shot. Conversely, several Takes can reuse the same
character-and-scene image and meet at natural editorial cuts. A genuinely continuous shot calls for
the model relationship and direction that preserve that action. See
[Reference relationships](generated-dependencies.md) when deciding which visual or motion evidence
should condition each request.

A prompt-directed jump cut asks the generator for an edited rhythm; it does not inspect or trim the
returned media. When produced footage needs a deterministic cut, speed change or trim, use the
corresponding media operation and align the edited result before it becomes a SemanticTake.

## Size the request around the delivery

Use `hypit measure` on a spoken Segment at its intended pace, including time for meaningful
interaction, pauses and actions. [Script and time](../../creation/script-and-time.md#measure-before-choosing-durations)
owns the command, rounding and the relationship between estimated duration and real aligned time.
Choose that pace from the intended performance and carry it into the voice and passage direction.
For brisk social delivery with trim cuts, `fast` is a useful starting choice; the name `normal`
does not make it the right rhythm for every piece. A shorter duration gives the words less room,
while the direction still supplies the stresses, attitude and reactions that make them engaging.
Measurement sizes the words; emphasis, attitude and motivated reactions give their delivery character.
The target's delivery determines how much generated media the passage needs; the reference video's
seconds help explain its rhythm without becoming the target duration automatically.

Read the selected video model's supported request lengths from its installed vocabulary. Those values
constrain one generation request without defining the finished work's Segment structure or edited
beats. When the estimate does not fit one request cleanly, reconsider the performable passage: a brief
question and answer may belong together, a short line may gain a meaningful reaction, and a long
exchange may divide where its thought turns. Preserve the intended meaning and energy, then choose a
supported duration.

After production, normalized media supplies the real envelope and alignment supplies word positions.
Use that material and timing to compose the piece. [Composition review](../../production/review.md)
owns judging how Caption, MG, B-roll and other layers work with the produced performance.
