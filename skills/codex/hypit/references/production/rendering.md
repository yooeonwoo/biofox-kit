# Composition and rendering

Read this when assembling the deliverable or rendering a frame interval for review. [Tracks](tracks.md)
explains the contributing layers; [Runs](runs.md) explains selecting existing media for this execution.

Composition chooses which pictures and sounds form the video and how they share space and time.
Rendering evaluates that composition over a frame interval and produces the encoded media. The
same composition can therefore be inspected in Studio, rendered in part, or rendered as a whole.

## Assemble the picture and sound

With the named inputs already declared:

```svml
<import as="film" from="@hypit/film@1"/>
<import as="render" from="@hypit/render-hyperframes@1"/>

<import as="sound" from="@hypit/sound@1"/>
<sound:Style id="voice-style"/>
<sound:Track id="voice" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <sound:Use style={voice-style}/>
</sound:Track>

<film:Film id="main" canvas={canvas} timeline={speech.timeline}
  appearance={look.film.main}>
  <film:Track source={performance.visual}/>
  <film:Track source={voice.audio}/>
  <film:Track source={coverage.visual}/>
  <film:Track source={captions.track}/>
  <film:Track source={music.track}/>
</film:Film>
<render:Video id="final" composition={main.composition} timeline={speech.timeline}/>
```

An example Film Recipe is `film.main { background: #18212A; }`. Canvas supplies the picture dimensions;
the Timeline supplies program time. Include each wanted audio output explicitly. A covering
picture leaves the included performance audio audible. Layer order is authored in the Tracks'
Presents, so moving these Film children does not reorder the picture.

`main.composition` is the assembled work, usable in Studio. `final.video` asks for an encoded video.
A compatible Composition from another component can also feed the render Surface.

## Compose an authored animation

A Film needs a time axis, whether or not it contains speech or prepared media. For a speech-led piece,
continue to pass `timeline={speech.timeline}`: it provides both the real performance time and the
context in which Tracks resolve Script references. For a pure MG piece, use the same Timeline with
an explicit end and zero Takes, and pass it to the components, Film and Render:

```svml
<import as="time" from="@hypit/timeline-author@1"/>
<time:Clock id="animation-clock" frame-rate="30"/>
<time:Timeline id="animation" clock={animation-clock} end="8s"/>

<!-- conversation is the project's own visual component. -->
<chat:Scene id="conversation" timeline={animation.timeline} canvas={canvas} font={font}
  during="program" title="Launch crew">
  <chat:Message id="question" sender="Maya" side="left" at="0.5s" text="Ready?"/>
  <chat:Message id="answer" sender="Leo" side="right" at="2s" text="Let's go."/>
</chat:Scene>
<film:Film id="main" canvas={canvas} timeline={animation.timeline} appearance={look.film.main}>
  <film:Track source={conversation.track}/>
</film:Film>
<render:Video id="final" composition={main.composition} timeline={animation.timeline}/>
```

The example assumes the Canvas, font, Film Recipe and project package are declared. Timeline's `end`
accepts seconds, milliseconds or frames and must end on a frame boundary. `Clock` remains the
separate duration-free input for normalizing real media. Drawing code produces the picture at each
requested frame; the Film's background supplies the canvas color. With no AudioTrack, the delivered
video is silent. Render ranges and worker settings apply in the same way as for spoken work.

Media, Typography, Audio and the graphic Tracks accept this same Timeline. Performance obtains
any available prepared footage from it. Caption
uses its speech-linked document; authored chat text belongs to the chat scene. The working example
`examples/semantic-composition/chat.svml` and its `@example/chat-scene` package show the complete
code-only composition, including scrolling and arbitrary message arrivals.

## Choose a render interval in frames

```svml
<render:Video id="detail" composition={main.composition} timeline={speech.timeline}
  start-frame="240" end-frame-exclusive="360"/>
```

Both bounds refer to the original program's frame clock. The interval includes frame 240 and ends
before 360: 120 frames, or seconds 8–12 at 30 fps. Omit both bounds for the whole program. For a
rational frame rate, compute seconds from its numerator and denominator rather than rounding the
rate first.

The original animation time remains intact, and picture and sound use the same interval. A short
Run can target `detail.video` while the normal Run continues to target `final.video`.
For this example, the renderer evaluates the original page at seconds 8–12 and encodes those frames
as a four-second clip starting at zero. An animation already in progress at second 8 keeps that state.

**The range limits final rendering. Upstream generation still follows the selected graph.** Keep
the Run Candidates for usable media and SemanticTakes when inspecting a Caption or MG revision.
Inspect `hypit plan` for the work that remains before submission. [Authoring](authoring.md#reuse-produced-work-explicitly)
explains choosing the reuse boundary.

## Execution and capacity

HyperFrames compiles the selected composition and renders its picture. Timeline audio is rendered
from the included AudioTracks, then picture and sound are muxed into the delivered file. A Runtime
can bind these capabilities to different compatible Endpoints.

For the local HyperFrames Provider, `workers` selects independent Chrome processes within one render.
They share the staged document and decoded source frames, capture different parts of the selected
interval, and produce one encoded result. Prefer `workers: "auto"` for ordinary local rendering;
the Provider adjusts capture concurrency within its reserved ceiling using the current job's work.
An explicit worker count preserves that deployment choice. `defaultConcurrency` limits simultaneous render Needs;
optional `browserCapacity` budgets their combined browser reservations. These belong to the Runtime
configuration; the Source keeps the same render declaration. [Runtime profiles](../environment/profile.md)
explains shared capacity and inspecting the selected Provider's configuration. The local HyperFrames
Provider supports range requests. A project Provider declares the request forms its deployment supports.

A short interval reduces frame capture and source-frame extraction, but still prepares the document's
declared assets and validates typed Surfaces. Extra browsers help only while the machine can use them;
preparation and final encoding contribute separately. Reusing media through the Run avoids generation work; it does
not preserve a previous render's temporary preparation.

For a local composition change, render the interval that shows the changed relationship and its
handoffs. Keep accepted material selected in the Run, then render the complete deliverable when
the composition is ready. Frame ranges reduce repeated work without changing the authored clock.
While rendering, communicate the current phase and meaningful progress. The Provider reports
decoding, browser startup, capture, encoding and storage; `hypit logs <build-id>` preserves their
timings and execution details when a slow or failed stage needs investigation.

A local render timeout ends that execution attempt and releases capacity after its work has stopped.
Its failure and already completed Outputs belong to the Build Result. Continue through a new Run
and Build that explicitly reuse the available media, as described in [Runs](runs.md).

Use [Builds and Results](builds.md) to submit, follow and retrieve `final.video` or `detail.video`.
Use [Review](review.md) to judge the observed interval or complete deliverable against the intended work.
