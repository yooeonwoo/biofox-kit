# Caption above a moving head

Use this when following a person's head adds character or keeps Caption clear of the image. The
relationship uses external face measurements, authored head regions and Fine's existing
placement input. The detector measures evidence; the author decides the Caption design.

## Produce the footage that will actually be measured

Build the speaking media and an ordinary composition first, using fixed Caption if useful. Keep the
Run's exact media and SemanticTake outputs available for reuse. A final-video Target can produce
those dependencies.

Measure footage whose timing and framing match the next composition. An existing rendered result
can work when its graphics do not obstruct detection. A clean picture pass is useful when they do;
it can reuse the same normalized Takes and layout. If measuring individual Takes instead, use their
actual edited lengths and project their local frame positions into the final program. Do not measure
an original raw file and silently assume its timestamps survive later trim, speed or crop changes.

## Obtain useful boxes outside Build

The worked method used Google Video Intelligence. Its face feature can return bounding boxes when
`FACE_DETECTION` is requested with `includeBoundingBoxes` enabled; facial attributes are unnecessary
for this placement task. Use the installed tool or the provider's
[face-detection example](https://docs.cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/samples/video-detect-faces)
for actual invocation and existing authorization for any paid request. Another suitable detector or
manual measurement can supply the same authored data. The stable Hypit input is the resulting
RegionTimeline, so detector invocation can remain an external, project-side preparation step.

GVI's timestamped boxes are observations, not Script Roles or ready-to-use Hypit head tracks. Its
[response schema](https://docs.cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/reference/rest/v1/AnnotateVideoResponse#TimestampedObject)
expresses `timeOffset` relative to the input video and the rectangle as `normalizedBoundingBox`.
Use all relevant observations, not just the first box printed by a sample program.

Treat the returned face tracks as candidate observations. Inspect representative frames from each
track and associate useful fragments with the intended Script Role. A detector track is not a global
person identity: a cut can split one guest across several tracks, and one shared shot can contain
several people. Combine the fragments that visibly belong to the Role in final program time. Selecting
the first or largest face alone can attach the guest's Caption to the interviewer.

## Author one head region per final program frame

Transform the useful observations into ordinary project data, with these decisions explicit:

- **Clock:** resample onto the Timeline's frame rate. A Take-local observation becomes global by
  adding that Take's actual placement start, including any authored gap or overlap. Sequential
  placement uses preceding prepared durations. Final-video measurements already use the global clock.
- **Geometry:** convert detector edges to `[x, y, width, height]` using width `right - left` and height
  `bottom - top`. If measurement used another resolution, crop, inset or split-screen panel, map the
  box through that actual placement before normalizing it to the final Canvas.
- **Head extent:** expand the face region to include the relevant hair, hat and desired clearance.
  For face `(x,y,w,h)`, authored padding fractions can produce
  `(x - pL*w, y - pT*h, w*(1+pL+pR), h*(1+pT+pB))`. Choose those fractions from the visible head;
  there is no universal face-to-head multiplier. Keep the resulting region valid inside the Canvas.
- **Missing observations:** make any interpolation or smoothing an explicit external preparation
  choice within a continuous shot and the same person. Inspect it, stop at cuts and occlusion, and
  write `null` when no usable region exists. Fine does not invent a missing box.
- **Role visibility:** intersect the assembled head regions with the turns where that Role is intended
  to own Caption, including only any lead or tail deliberately wanted at the boundary. Write `null`
  through other speakers' turns and other intervals. This prevents a correctly detected face from
  becoming placement evidence for Caption that does not belong to that person.

The final array has exactly one box or `null` per program frame. Caption already follows the Role's
spoken Cues; the region track supplies measured position and an explicit visibility boundary, not a
second speech detector. Other composition choices, such as hiding that Role's Caption under B-roll,
can use the same authored null regions or the appropriate Caption selection behavior.

For example, this is a three-frame data-shape illustration, not a ready timeline for a real video:

```svs
heads.default {
  frame-count: 3;
  tracks: [
    {"id":"GUEST","regions":[[0.12,0.09,0.20,0.26],null,[0.13,0.10,0.20,0.26]]}
  ];
}
```

Keep the actual array in a project Recipe such as `tracking.svs`. A small project script can make
these transformations reproducible when needed, taking explicit media, clock and geometry inputs.

## Connect the measured placement and render again

```svml
<space:RegionTimeline id="heads" within={vertical} recipe={tracking.heads.default}/>
<caption-fine:Track id="captions" document={story.caption}
  timeline={speech.timeline} regions={heads}>
  <caption-fine:Use style={caption-style}/>
</caption-fine:Track>
```

The RegionTimeline's ids match Script Roles. Fine places a single-Role Cue at that region's top
center; `anchor-x: center` and `anchor-y: bottom` put the Cue above it. The Style still owns its width,
font and motion. A named Role track with `null` hides its Cue on that frame; a Role with no region
track uses its ordinary Style position. This allows tracked guest Caption and fixed interviewer
Caption together. The `@hypit/spatial` and `@hypit/caption-fine` READMEs own the exact data behavior.

Select the existing media and alignment outputs in the Run as described in
[production authoring](../../production/authoring.md#reuse-produced-work-explicitly), then inspect
`hypit plan` before rebuilding. A Caption placement change should reuse the paid Takes. Review
representative frames, camera cuts and the moving result for jitter, wrong-person jumps, hair/hat
clearance, top-edge clipping and collisions with icons. Local frame-range rendering makes these
iterations cheap. If media timing or placement changes, update the affected measurements rather
than reusing stale coordinates.
