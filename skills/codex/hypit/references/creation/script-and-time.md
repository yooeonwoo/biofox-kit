# Script and semantic time

Read this before writing or revising `<script>`, when balancing spoken delivery across generated
Takes, or when attaching pictures, Captions, MG, Effects, and Audio to what is said. It also explains
how a passage with no spoken words receives semantic boundaries. This page contains the complete
stable author-facing Script vocabulary; the installed `@hypit/script` package owns parser validation
and edge cases.

[Source syntax](../production/source-syntax.md) covers the surrounding imports, references, Recipes
and Runs; [Tracks](../production/tracks.md) covers the consumers of Script meaning.
[Timeline authoring](../production/timeline.md) places Takes, allows gaps and overlaps, and declares
the complete work, including pure MG with no Script.
[Media preparation](../production/media.md) explains connecting actual footage to a Segment, and
[Runs](../production/runs.md) explains targeting material and reusing produced Takes.

## Script is the target's sole verbal authority

`<script>` contains the words the target video will say. It contains no reference timecodes, media,
visual Style parameters, prompts, or provider decisions. Semantic word attributes such as
`useful{emphasis}` can identify a word's role for a Caption family. Brief may preserve required claims and Treatment may describe
the purpose of a passage, but the adopted wording appears in Source only once.

Choose Script structure from the thought being expressed and the performance carrying it:

- a **Segment** groups a performable passage around its thought, delivery and action; its accepted
  media can become one SemanticTake;
- a **Role Cue** assigns a spoken turn to a performer and carries that label into the model's dialogue;
- **Dual Text** gives one authored unit separate display and pronunciation text;
- `||` says that one on-screen **Caption Cue** hands off to the next after a complete Alignment Unit;
- a **word attribute** gives a Caption family an authored role on one displayed word;
- a **Selection** names the span of meaning an element serves, such as a demonstration covering an
  explanation or a comparison held through a claim;
- a **Moment** names an event such as an answer or verdict, where graphics, sound or effects can
  respond together. The component decides how the resulting state continues.

```svml
<script id="story">
  <hook>
    <HOST> @claim! I made the @proof <API | A P I> || work overnight @/proof.
  </hook>
</script>
```

Here the viewer reads `API` while the performance receives `A P I`. The pair is one indivisible
Alignment Unit. `||` ends one on-screen Caption Cue after that unit and lets the next Cue begin with
`work`; `proof` remains one semantic range, and `claim` is a semantic point that other layers can use.

A Cue is a timed block of displayed speech, not a line of text. Its Caption family and Recipe may
wrap that block over one or more lines, reveal or highlight its words, and give the block an entrance,
exit or handoff. Segment boundaries and Role turns already separate Cues. Caption Use windows can change a
Style midway through a Cue while preserving its content and original word times.
Use `||` when the same Segment, turn and Style still needs another deliberate reading handoff. The
[Caption craft](../playbooks/craft/captions.md#design-cue-rhythm-with-the-caption-system) owns how the
picture, language, family and Recipe shape that decision.

The author-facing forms are:

| Form | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<opening>...</opening>` | A Segment named `opening`; all spoken prose belongs inside a Segment. |
| `<pause/>` | A self-closing Segment with identity and boundaries but no words. |
| `<HOST>` | A Role Cue inside the current Segment; it applies until another Role Cue or the Segment end. |
| `<display text \| spoken text>` | One Dual Text unit with separate visible and pronounced wording. |
| `<display text\|>` | One complete display/speech unit using the same wording for both; individual spoken word times remain available. |
| `< \| spoken text>` | Spoken words that keep semantic timing while contributing no visible Caption words. |
| `||` | A Caption Cue handoff between complete Alignment Units. |
| `word{emphasis,keyword}` | Boolean attributes on one complete display word for a Caption family to interpret. |
| `word{importance=2,tone=warm}` | Named string, number or boolean attribute values on that display word. |
| `@proof ... @/proof` | A Selection: one named semantic range. |
| `@claim!` | A Moment: one named semantic point. |

A Script contains one or more uniquely named lower-case Segments. A paired Segment can carry prose
or be wordless; the self-closing form also carries a wordless passage. A Role Cue is a bare turn marker rather than a
paired element: the next Role Cue begins the next turn, and closing the Segment ends the final turn
and resets its Role. When a Segment uses Roles, place the first Role before that Segment's first
spoken text. One Segment can contain several Role turns without requiring several generated Takes.

Dual Text can contain several visible or spoken words on either side; its display side feeds Caption
and its spoken side feeds pronunciation. An empty display side intentionally omits those spoken words
from Caption while keeping them in the Narrative and semantic timing. Selections and Moments can be
placed on the spoken side because that side owns the speech anchors. Place Cue Breaks around the
complete Dual Text unit, not inside it. Attributes for a displayed Dual Text word belong on the
display side before the pipe. Inside that display side, use `\@` when the visible text itself needs an
at-sign.

When the wording is identical, `<组件化|>` is shorthand for `<组件化|组件化>`. It can group a name,
compound or phrase for Caption presentation while leaving its spoken Tokens and timing intact:
`把<动效|><组件化|>。|| 以后就能<直接复用|>。` Choose groups for the intended expression; ordinary
Chinese prose does not require word-by-word markup. The group's Style determines its visual response;
`||` still controls which reading phrases appear as separate Cues.

With speech omitted, the left side supplies both projections, so semantic markers can be placed
there and Studio writes back there: `<组@beat!件化|>`. Display attributes and markers are metadata,
not spoken words. Attributes still apply to the preceding display word rather than the whole group.
With an explicit spoken side, markers continue to belong on that right-hand side.

Script comments use ordinary Markup comments outside the prose:

```svml
<!-- This note enters no text projection. -->
<social><HOST> Follow us \@hypit.</social>
```

Reserved Script punctuation remains literal when escaped: `\@` produces `@`, `\<` produces `<`,
`\{` produces `{`, `\}` produces `}`, `\|` produces `|`, and `\\` produces `\`. A plain `>` needs
no escape in ordinary prose; inside Dual Text, `\>` keeps it from closing that unit. A single `|` in
ordinary prose is literal; `||` is the Caption Cue handoff. Inside Dual Text, the first unescaped `|`
separates display from pronunciation; write `\|` for a literal pipe and `\|\|` for two literal pipes.
These escapes belong to Script prose, while structured Source attributes and elements use the Markup
escaping described in [Source syntax](../production/source-syntax.md).

Script derives speech tokens from words and numbers. Punctuation remains attached to the displayed
word it belongs with and does not create another speech time unit. CJK prose commonly contributes
one Han, Hiragana or Katakana character per lexical unit; compounds, decimal numbers and the spoken
side of Dual Text preserve their own lexical structure. This is why Cue breaks, word attributes and
semantic markers attach to complete authored units instead of punctuation or visual line positions.
Character-level timing does not call for character-sized Cues: use `||` for meaningful reading
phrases. [Caption craft](../playbooks/craft/captions.md#language-changes-the-reading-unit) explains
Chinese, English and mixed-script grouping, spacing and their fit in the picture.

## Write the intended pronunciation

Choose pronunciation while writing the Script. For coined names, unfamiliar brands and abbreviations
whose reading needs direction, use Dual Text to keep the intended display spelling and give the
performer a clear spoken form. Write that form as readable words, syllables or letter names in the
performed language. Keep ordinary spelling when it already expresses the intended reading; an
English name inside Chinese speech does not automatically need a phonetic replacement. The spoken
side is literal model input, so invented respellings and punctuation can suggest unintended sounds.
Use a reading established for the selected language and voice, and retain the user's chosen spelling.

```svml
<script id="story">
  <opening>
    <HOST> This app connects through an <API | A P I>.
  </opening>
  <closing>
    <HOST> The same <API | A P I> works here too.
  </closing>
</script>
```

Each pair applies to that occurrence. Carry the chosen spoken form into every occurrence of the
name, including other Segments, so separately generated performances receive the same direction.
The right-hand wording reaches the model through the Segment's `.dialogue`; Caption keeps the
display spelling. Settle these readings before measuring the Script and requesting its performance.

The same distinction helps Chinese copy express numbers and names clearly. For example,
`今年<2026|二零二六>年` displays the year compactly while specifying how it is said;
`只要<¥19.9|十九块九>` chooses a conversational price reading. Choose the spoken form for this
sentence's meaning and delivery. Measuring the Segment with `--language zh` then uses that spoken
wording, including the syllables hidden behind its compact numeric display. Caption retains the
authored simplified or traditional characters; transcription supplies timing rather than rewriting
the displayed Script.

## Use the Script's deliberate projections

One Script publishes the full Narrative and the narrow views needed by the rest of the work:

| Reference | What it carries |
| --- | --- |
| `{story}` | The complete authored Narrative. |
| `{story.segment.hook}` | The `hook` Segment as a NarrativeExcerpt for one SemanticTake. |
| `{story.segment.hook.dialogue}` | Role-aware dialogue using the spoken side of Dual Text, suitable for a speaking performance request. |
| `{story.segment.hook.speech}` | Pronunciation-only Text, suitable for `hypit measure` or independent speech. |
| `{story.caption}` | Display Words, Alignment Units, attributes, Roles, and authored Cue Breaks for Caption. |
| `{story.selection.proof}` | The named semantic range. |
| `{story.moment.claim}` | The named semantic point. |

For example, this Segment inside `story` assigns two speaking turns:

```svml
<exchange>
  <HOST> Let me show you.
  <GUEST> That looks much easier.
</exchange>
```

`{story.segment.exchange.dialogue}` supplies:

```text
HOST: Let me show you.
GUEST: That looks much easier.
```

Pass that Text to the speaking prompt. In action direction, relate HOST and GUEST to the supplied
character views and voices. The selected [Prompt Kit](../production/prompt-kits.md) owns its reference
order; [podcast direction](../playbooks/formats/two-person-podcast.md#direct-conversation-inside-a-take)
shows how those roles and references form one performed exchange.

These are projections of one authored Script, not copies to maintain. The performance request,
Caption system, and semantic timing therefore remain connected even when their visible and spoken
wording differ.

Script also represents passages without speech:

```svml
<script id="story">
  <empty></empty>
</script>
```

`empty` is an ordinary Segment name; a name such as `product-detail` can express the passage's role.
No words does not mean no semantics: the Segment retains its identity and start/end anchors. Its
associated normalized media determines the duration, and its SemanticTake has an empty word array.
The same Timeline and Track timing vocabulary apply to a wordless passage or an entire
piece made from prepared media. The empty tag itself declares neither a zero-length interval nor a duration.
For an interval made only of component animation, use Timeline placement and extent instead; it
needs no media-backed Segment. Spoken, wordless-media and graphics-only passages can share one work.

Choose Segment boundaries from natural production passages and delivery length, not from every
picture cut. One Segment and Take can carry several speaking turns, camera cuts or a split-screen
conversation. One continuous narration can carry many B-roll changes through Selections. Edited UGC
can deliberately use several Takes driven by the same character-and-scene image; a natural cut is
often part of its appeal. A Role change or `||` does not require another generation.

## Time an authored animation

For speech-led work, a graphic's timing usually follows what it explains. Preserve that relationship
in Script: a reveal belongs to its Moment, and coverage belongs to its Selection. Rewriting the
argument or changing the performance then carries the design into the target's actual timing.
Reference seconds document what you observed; the target Script expresses what the new graphic follows.

A chat animation, diagram or kinetic-text piece can instead be drawn entirely by components. Its
messages and changes still carry meaning; the author chooses when the audience receives them and
how long they need to read. Keep content and event timing together in the owning component's Source.
An event can have an identity such as `question` or `reveal` and an authored `at="2.6s"` without
inventing spoken words or a media-backed Segment. Film time is declared through a Timeline with an explicit end and zero Takes;
[composition and rendering](../production/rendering.md#compose-an-authored-animation) shows the form.

Choose timing per relationship, not once for the whole video. A spoken Moment can introduce a chat
scene whose messages then unfold at authored intervals. Conversely, an authored animation can reveal
one item on a spoken Moment. A projected expression such as `instant="moment.cue + 12f"` with
`moment={story.moment.intro}` keeps an interval relative to that spoken event. The event's trigger
and its entrance duration are different choices:
`at={story.moment.answer}` locates the answer; ten frames can give its arrival a particular character.

## Measure before choosing durations

For a new or revised A-roll performance, choose time from the target's words, delivery, and action.
The reference timeline remains useful for understanding rhythm and relationships; the new performance
establishes their actual timing. Even unchanged words may take a different amount of time with a new
speaker or delivery.

`hypit measure` is the creation-time command for `@hypit/estimate`. It counts pronunciation units and
estimates how many seconds they need at the chosen language and pace, using local computation:

```bash
hypit measure path/to/source.svml --segment opening --language en --pace normal
hypit measure --text "You expect me to type every coffee?" --language en --pace normal --rounding ceil
hypit measure path/to/source.svml --segment opening --language zh --pace fast --rounding round
```

Choose `--pace slow|normal|fast` from the intended delivery: conversational explanation may suit
`normal`, while brisk, tightly cut social delivery often suits `fast`. The CLI prints the actual
units-per-second rate; `--rate` lets you choose it directly. Mandarin counts Han characters as
approximate syllables and embedded English by syllable; English counts syllables rather than words.
Set `--language zh` for Chinese copy, including copy with English product names, and measure the
pronunciation side of Dual Text with `--segment`.

The density includes ordinary phrasing pauses. `--padding` reserves additional time for an intended
reaction, demonstration or held pause. Keep related performances at a coherent delivery density. Initial
estimates can retain fractions with `--rounding none`. `ceil` rounds upward to a whole second, while
`round` chooses the nearest one. Most video requests use whole seconds; choose the final literal with
the selected model's supported values and the intended performance in mind.

An energetic performance can still give a dense explanation room to breathe. Use the reference's
pronunciation-unit count over its spoken passages to inform a candidate rate, then choose for the target's language,
terminology and actions. Inspect the effective density after rounding each request: fitting every
line into the shortest supported duration can make the whole delivery rushed. Keep the chosen rate
and meaningful padding with the production's direction so later Segments follow the same decision.

Let that estimate inform the shape of the passage. A short line may belong with the next response,
benefit from a little fuller wording, or leave room for a meaningful action. A long passage may read
better with tighter copy or a split at a natural change of thought. Preserve the intended meaning and
energy while finding a performable shape, then measure the affected wording again. The
[Generated video direction](../playbooks/craft/video-direction.md#size-the-request-around-the-delivery)
applies this judgment to the selected model's request range.

Measurement balances the intended speaking density and sizes generation; it supplies no timeline
anchors. Once a Take is accepted, normalize it, align its actual speech to its Script Segment, and
assemble the resulting SemanticTakes into the Timeline. The literal duration answers how much
media to request. The aligned words answer where Caption, B-roll, MG, and Effects belong in that actual
media. Alignment measures real word positions inside that media envelope; it does not reproduce an
estimated distribution of words.

For a wordless Segment, choose the requested duration from the action, music or visual rhythm.
Speech-rate measurement has no role there; the resulting media still determines its Segment span.

## Bind meaning to Script identities

For a picture, Caption treatment, MG state, sound, or effect that belongs to spoken meaning, author a
Selection or Moment and use the consuming component's Surface to project it through the Timeline.
Use explicit seconds for genuinely clock-based or speechless design.

Selections may overlap, cross, or span Segments; they are named semantic ranges rather than nested
markup. Selection and Moment names share one namespace. Inside spoken text, each marker chooses an
adjacent semantic boundary:

| Marker | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `@name` | Open a Selection at the next word's start. |
| `~@name` | Open a Selection at the previous word's end. |
| `@/name` | Close a Selection at the previous word's end. |
| `@/name~` | Close a Selection at the next word's start. |
| `@name!` | Place a Moment at the next word's start. |
| `~@name!` | Place a Moment at the previous word's end. |

Markers may sit between or outside Segments when the meaning crosses structural passages. For
example, this Selection owns the complete Script program rather than borrowing the first and last
word boundaries:

```svml
~@whole
<opening><HOST>First thought.</opening>
<answer><HOST>Final answer.</answer>
@/whole~
```

At a Script or Segment edge, the corresponding structural boundary remains available even when
there is no neighboring word. Thus `@videos videos @/videos` covers exactly that word. For adjacent
B-roll windows that should also own the pause between words, choose which neighboring Selection
owns that gap through the explicit affinities; [B-roll craft](../playbooks/craft/b-roll.md) shows the
shared-boundary forms.

The consuming component's Surface projects the authored identity through the real Timeline.
For example, `during={story.selection.proof}` on a visual Item makes that Surface construct a Window.
A persistent MG reveal can use `at={story.moment.claim}` to consume an Instant; an Audio Item uses
`at={story.moment.claim} for="600ms"` to occupy a Window. The component's Fragment and Producers
consume that value and own playback, visible duration, animation, and state behavior; Script supplies
the meaning and its Anchors.

Surfaces that expose Hypit's shared temporal vocabulary accept the forms appropriate to their role.
A Window occupies an interval:

| Form | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `during="program"` | The complete program Window. |
| `during={story.segment.hook}` | The Segment's Window. |
| `during={story.selection.proof}` | The Selection's Window, including its authored affinities. |
| `at={story.moment.claim} for="8f"` | A Window beginning at a Moment and lasting eight frames. |
| `at="2s" for="12f"` | A Window beginning two seconds into the film and lasting twelve frames. |
| `until={story.moment.claim} for="250ms"` | A 250 ms Window ending at a Moment. |
| `start="program.start" end="moment.cue" moment={story.moment.claim}` | A Window composed from two explicit endpoints. |

Each Window uses one complete form. Explicit endpoint expressions can use `program.start`,
`program.end`, `selection.start`, `selection.end`, `segment.start`, `segment.end`, or `moment.cue`,
with the corresponding semantic reference supplied alongside it. They can also use a clock position
such as `1.5s` or an offset such as `selection.start - 2f`. Frames and milliseconds are integers;
seconds may be fractional.

An Instant names one point:

| Form | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `at={story.moment.claim}` | The authored Moment. |
| `at="2s"` or `at="12f"` | A point on the film clock, in seconds or frames. |
| `at={story.selection.proof} boundary="start"` | The Selection's chosen boundary. |
| `at={story.segment.hook} boundary="end"` | The Segment's chosen boundary. |
| `instant="program.start + 8f"` | An explicit clock expression. |
| `instant="moment.cue + 12f" moment={story.moment.claim}` | Twelve frames after the Moment, following it when the delivery changes. |

`at="12f"` locates an event; `for="12f"` gives an interval its length. Frames use the selected
film clock. Semantic projection keeps the event's Script identity alongside its resolved frame,
so its authored relationship remains available for later changes.

A particular Surface may deliberately expose only some of these forms. Its vocabulary reports the
attributes it actually accepts; the shared spelling does not grant every component every temporal
behavior.

Reference archives keep original seconds and explain which original words or content events an item
serves. The target Source names the intended relation against the target Script. After the target's
actual audio is aligned, the Timeline supplies its frames. Do not copy a reference timestamp into
the target or preserve an incidental lead/lag unless that offset itself is part of the design.

## Connect reference understanding to audiovisual composition

Timing seen in Studio or a real Result may expose one of several different problems. A wrong Cue or
semantic anchor changes Script. A sound performance that changes the intended rhythm may change the
duration choice or Treatment. A correct Selection rendered badly changes the component or Recipe. An
unusable generated Take changes its prompt, reference, Candidate, or shot design. Put each correction
where its fact is owned.
