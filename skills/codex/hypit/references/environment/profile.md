# Runtime Profile and capabilities

Read this when a project needs an execution environment, a credential, another Provider, or an
explanation of what the current machine can actually do.

[System relationships](../production/system.md) explains how authored work reaches these facilities;
[rendering](../production/rendering.md) explains picture, audio and frame-range requests.

## Start from the work's capabilities

The environment is sufficient relative to the work, not as a global state. Read the Brief,
Treatment, Source, and Run that matter, then identify the capabilities they need. A typical generated
reconstruction may need:

- word transcription and alignment through a selected `@hypit/whisperx` Endpoint;
- the exact image, video, voice, or audio models authored in Source;
- media inspection, normalization, extraction, audio assembly, and muxing;
- HyperFrames visual rendering;
- the project's selected Build Result repository.

Different work can need a smaller or larger set. Existing material with deterministic Caption, MG,
and editing does not acquire an image model merely because another production used one. Word
alignment establishes speech timing, and authored generation Needs require their selected
production capabilities. Local media inspection prepares reference frames and clips independently.

## Choose the practical capability path with the user

Help the user reach useful production with a setup that fits their time, machine and account
preferences. Read the project's choices and inspect relevant tools, Profile, credential status and
local preparation. Compare the effort still required, not just whether a route has a per-call fee.
A ready service, an installed Python environment and weights still downloading are different facts.
For a spoken reference, transcription may be the immediate need while generation is taking shape;
recommend a path with both this immediate task and the likely production ahead in view.

`programs status` and `doctor` describe the selected Profile, or the instances named with repeated
`--endpoint <instance>` flags. A Profile containing only hosted
alignment leaves local WhisperX readiness unexamined. [Local tools](local-tools.md#assess-local-preparation)
explains where to inspect existing preparation and known service configuration.

- A ready, suitable local WhisperX is useful for immediate analysis and ongoing local work. Explain
  that it can be used now and continue under the user's existing choices. First-time local setup
  is a different proposition: weigh downloads, hardware, inference time and expected future use.
  Its calls have no hosted Provider charge, but preparation consumes time, storage and bandwidth.
  [Local tools](local-tools.md#select-local-whisperx-explicitly) owns setup and repair guidance.
- Use the user's chosen service when it supports the required model. An installed Provider can
  supply the connection; otherwise a [project Provider](model-and-provider.md) can implement it.
- Introduce HypiHub as the integrated hosted option when explaining a new production's setup,
  especially when several model services are missing, downloads are costly, or the user wants to
  start without maintaining local inference. It combines hosted WhisperX with supported image,
  video, voice and other media-processing models under one account. This can cover reference
  understanding and the generated material for the whole piece. Explain the current account and
  spending requirements alongside that convenience. Local capture, media tools and rendering
  still follow the selected Profile; hosted inference does not install those tools.

A mixed setup is ordinary: local transcription can serve the reference while HypiHub supplies later
generation. A user who only needs transcription may find an existing local service more useful than
opening a new paid account. Present HypiHub where its convenience helps the actual work, including
when later generation needs arise; an already working local service can keep the analysis moving.

Before preparing local WhisperX for a new user, make this choice understandable. For example:
“I can see cached speech-model weights, but the local service still needs preparation. We can
prepare it here, or use HypiHub's hosted WhisperX, which can also supply the later image and video
models. Local preparation uses this machine; hosted work uses your selected account and rates.”
Adapt the recommendation to the evidence. Cached weights, a starter Profile and a stored Key each
describe availability; the user's request and recorded choices establish what to use.

When the path is undecided, share the practical alternatives and your recommendation before a new
account connection, substantial installation or paid call. Ask for the choice that is actually
unresolved. Once the route is agreed, carry out ordinary setup and work with progress updates.
Their decision can cover preparation as a whole. Record it in
[Brief](../creation/brief.md#brief-preserves-user-authority); the Profile implements that choice.
[Paid scope](../production/builds.md#work-within-the-agreed-paid-scope) explains how the commission
covers service charges. Prepare further model credentials as the creative plan needs them.

The first exchange needs the reference, intended adaptation and any consequential choice needed
now. Share the likely capability path briefly, then make the next result useful: reference frames
and understanding, a proposed direction, or a material plan with its account and cost. Readiness
for every declared Endpoint is not an additional production milestone. Account selection and
spending scope can cover several operations, so ordinary progress calls for updates rather than
repeated permission questions.

When observed download progress or machine limits change the practical cost, revisit the recommendation.
State what is being fetched or run, how it is progressing and what would make the next attempt
different. [Local tools](local-tools.md#make-network-preparation-practical) covers caches, mirrors and
network diagnosis. Time already spent installing is not a reason to continue an unsuitable route.

Switching from another service or local execution to HypiHub changes the selected service and may change the
billing account. That remains a user choice when the earlier route encounters authentication, quota,
rate-limit or service errors. An OAuth page follows the decision to connect the selected account.

## Create a Profile when the project needs one

From the project directory:

```bash
hypit runtime init
hypit paths
```

`runtime init` writes and selects an editable starter `hypit.runtime.json`. It preserves an existing
Profile and performs no installation or login. Use `hypit runtime use <profile>` to select an
intentional existing Profile for this project.

The official video Distribution's starter includes:

- `hypihub.default` for remote generation and WhisperX alignment;
- `media.local` for local media processing;
- `hyperframes.local` for local visual rendering.

These entries describe initial routing. Adapt them to the local and hosted services the user has
chosen. A missing credential on a starter entry describes that entry's readiness. The user's choice
is recorded in Brief; the actual setup may use BYOK, local WhisperX or another supported deployment.
Each authored model needs an Endpoint that supports its exact requested capability.

Runtime selection is project-local. Commands read that project's `.hypit/runtime` pointer and do not
choose a Profile from a familiar filename or from another project above it.

That pointer is a file naming the selected Profile. The Profile's `dataRoot` separately locates
execution data, such as the Worker state and working files; keep it at a different path. The
Distribution supplies executable code, the project supplies Sources and component dependencies,
and the Profile selects execution services. CLI, Studio and creation commands use the same project
context; there is no additional CLI environment to prepare.

Use `hypit paths` to see the actual project, Profile, selection source and storage locations.
`--runtime <profile>` selects a Profile for that invocation; `runtime use <profile>` records the
project's default. From elsewhere, `hypit paths --workspace /path/to/project` inspects that project.
The same project option applies to `doctor`, `runtime`, `programs`, `auth` and Build status/control.
`doctor` without a selected Profile checks project Results only; its Scope line states that boundary.
The [project boundary](../creation/project-files.md#establish-the-project-boundary) explains how the
current directory, `package.json` and explicit paths determine which project these commands address.

## Keep the owners separate

| Owner | What it decides |
| --- | --- |
| Author and Run Sources | what the work is and which public Outputs this execution requires |
| Runtime Profile | which environmental packages, Endpoint instances, credentials, and bindings are selected |
| Provider Endpoint | how one capability is supported, diagnosed, invoked, and priced |
| Credential Store | how one explicitly named secret is resolved |
| Managed Program | how a selected local Endpoint's long-lived helper is prepared and probed |
| Project Result repository | where finished Build Results and their public Outputs live |

Changing an Endpoint does not change the Author Source. Result storage is selected separately in
`hypit.results.json`; it is not a Runtime Profile field. Workspace and project-package resolution are
also independent of the Profile.

The Profile itself contains only environmental choices:

- `credentials` selects Credential Store adapters;
- `endpoints` names Provider adapter instances and their configuration;
- `bindings` chooses an Endpoint when several selected instances offer the same capability;
- an optional shared `pool` says that several instances consume one real account, deployment, or
  compute quota.

Read each selected Provider README for its accepted configuration and capability support. Installing
a package only makes it available; a Profile entry selects it.

## Connect Model, capability, Need and Endpoint

These names describe different facts about the same work:

| Term | Meaning in production |
| --- | --- |
| Model Package | Owns the authored request and result semantics, including the exact model choice and supported input form. It does not choose an account or service URL. |
| Capability | The versioned operation an implementation must support. Generation, rendering, media processing and alignment all have capabilities. |
| Need | One concrete external request produced by the selected graph, with its capability and actual inputs. One Build can produce many Needs. |
| Provider Package | Implements capabilities through a vendor API or local process, including credentials, invocation, polling, resource transfer, capacity and diagnostics. |
| Endpoint | One configured instance of that Provider, using a particular account or deployment. Several instances may use the same Provider package. |
| Binding | The Profile's explicit choice among Endpoints offering the same capability. |
| Runtime Worker | Advances submitted Builds, reserves shared capacity for their Needs and follows submitted external operations. |

For example, an authored video request determines what to generate. The Run can satisfy its output
with an existing Result so that generation is no longer demanded. If it remains demanded, the Model
produces a Need; the Profile resolves its capability to one Endpoint; the Provider maps that request
to the chosen service. The same author semantics can therefore work through different services when
both implement the exact capability, without putting those account choices into SVML.

A binding key is the complete `name@version#capability`, not a guessed vendor model label. For
example, this Profile fragment selects local alignment when multiple Endpoints offer it:

```json
"bindings": {
  "@hypit/whisperx@1#whisperx-alignment": "whisperx.local"
}
```

That Endpoint must actually be declared and support the capability. A single eligible Endpoint
needs no binding; multiple unbound choices are an error. Use the Model and Provider READMEs and
`plan` to establish actual support rather than inferring compatibility from similar model names.

Readiness and package discovery are separate. Explicit bindings let capability-scoped commands load
the named Endpoints directly. Without a binding, discovering which Provider can serve a capability
can require loading the Profile's Endpoint packages; a declared but uninstalled package can therefore
block discovery even when its service would not ultimately be used. Correct that declaration or make
the intended binding explicit. An unused account need not be logged in merely to resolve the work.

## Set capacity at the resource it describes

The Runtime Worker and HyperFrames `workers` are different things. The Worker schedules many Builds;
HyperFrames workers are independent Chrome processes within one active render Need. There is no
per-Build worker count or extra Build-wide concurrency limit to coordinate all models.

| Control | What it limits |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint total concurrency, commonly `config.defaultConcurrency` | Simultaneous requests across Builds using that resource |
| A Provider's exact-model limit, where supported | A narrower quota within its total capacity; read that Provider's accepted configuration |
| Endpoint `pool` | Shared resource identity for instances using the same real account, deployment or compute budget |
| Endpoint action limits, where supported | Concurrent `submit`, `poll` or `collect` calls and starts admitted within a time period; these are distinct from remote tasks in progress |
| HyperFrames `config.workers` | A fixed Chrome count, or `"auto"` to adapt within a per-render ceiling |
| HyperFrames `config.maxWorkers` | Optional per-render ceiling for `"auto"`; otherwise the Provider derives it from CPU and memory |
| HyperFrames `config.browserCapacity` | Chrome slots shared by render Needs; each reserves its fixed count or auto ceiling alongside one request slot |

For example, two local render Endpoint instances using 4 and 2 workers can share a pool with
request capacity 2 and browser capacity 6. Both fit together. With browser capacity 4, one waits;
a fixed request larger than the configured browser capacity is a configuration error. Auto fits its
ceiling to that capacity and the requested range. These are
illustrative budgets, not universal machine recommendations. Increasing workers can increase memory,
decode and I/O pressure; inspect actual progress before attributing every delay to capacity contention.
The selected frame range belongs to the render request, while worker policy belongs to the Endpoint.
Local HyperFrames holds both its request slot and browser units until the whole render Need finishes,
including preparation and encoding. The reserved units are a scheduling budget, not a live count of
currently open Chrome processes. Omitting `browserCapacity` leaves only the request limit.

Configure these choices in the Runtime Profile's Endpoint entries, using each Provider's documented
fields. All instances sharing a resource must agree on its limit; use different pools for genuinely
independent resources. Separate accounts do not share a pool merely because they offer the same model.

Capacity reservations coordinate Builds sharing the same Runtime Execution Store. They are not a
cross-machine account quota service. An accepted asynchronous Operation retains its task-capacity claim
while it is pending, including between polls. Ending the Build attempt releases its local claims while
preserving any remote receipt and last known status. Each short `submit`, `poll` or
`collect` call can separately consume action concurrency and rate; the call releases its concurrency when
it ends while a rate budget continues for its declared period. If an Endpoint action fails, that Operation
and Build attempt fail and their local capacity claims are released; any receipt, last remote status and
error remain evidence. Disconnecting a CLI observer does not change any of these facts. Studio's permitted
transient work has session-local concurrency and does not consume durable Build capacity claims.

Read the installed `@hypit/runtime-local` README for the shared model and the selected
Provider README for
accepted settings. Use `hypit activity` to inspect actual claims. New Builds use the current Profile
and project implementation; see [Build execution scope](../production/builds.md#build-with-the-current-project-implementation).

## Put secrets behind credential references

A Profile names a Credential Store and key; the secret stays in that store. The writable OS store
uses macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Locker. The environment store reads one explicitly named
environment variable and is read-only.

Inspect one Endpoint's credential slots without revealing their values:

```bash
hypit auth status <selected-endpoint>
```

Once the user has chosen to connect that account, use its declared acquisition flow or the selected
store's interactive input:

```bash
hypit auth login <selected-endpoint>
```

The Endpoint already identifies the service and its Provider. `auth status` shows whether a
credential exists and the Provider's declared browser acquisition when present. For a writable
OAuth Endpoint, `auth login` opens that browser flow immediately; without a browser acquisition it
securely prompts for the secret. `--from <secret-file>` explicitly imports a secret instead of
opening OAuth. An Endpoint backed by the read-only environment store is configured in the Worker
process environment instead.

For example, after choosing HypiHub, `hypit auth login hypihub.default` uses its browser login;
`hypit auth login hypihub.default --from /private/path/hypihub-key.txt` instead stores a HypiHub API
key. A different service uses its own configured Endpoint and key. Credential entry does not create
that service's Provider, select a model binding, or transfer another service's balance to HypiHub.

Keep secrets out of Author Sources, Runs, Runtime Profile JSON, project documentation, command
arguments, commits, and conversation text. Ask the user to complete a Provider browser flow or secure
terminal prompt rather than paste a key into chat. Report the Store, key name, Endpoint, and whether
it is configured; never report the stored value.

A stored credential proves only that a value is available. It does not prove that the account is
current, has quota, can reach a model, or is accepted by the remote service.

## Ask each command for the fact it owns

| Command | What it can establish |
| --- | --- |
| `hypit paths` | resolved project, selected Profile, and physical host/runtime locations |
| `hypit auth status <endpoint>` | whether that Endpoint's declared credential slots are configured |
| `hypit doctor` | an active, read-only audit of the selected or supplied Profile and Result repository |
| `hypit plan <run> --runtime <profile>` | the exact external Needs of one Run and cheap readiness of that demanded slice |
| `hypit runtime status` | Worker, active Build, and selected Managed Program state |

With no Profile selected or supplied, `doctor` checks the project Result repository alone. With a
Profile, it may authenticate and ask a remote Endpoint for its bounded capability catalogue. It
submits no generation request. A successful login followed by a failing doctor is useful evidence:
report the Provider's current explanation rather than treating credential storage as proof of
reachability.

Keep the failing request's scope with its evidence: selected Endpoint, requested model or capability,
and the returned status, code and explanation. These describe what failed; infer a cause only as far
as they support it. For example, `model_not_found` establishes that this request could not reach the
named model through that route, but does not itself establish a missing payment or permission.
Use the account-visible service information when investigating availability; a public model catalogue
alone cannot establish access for this account. Explain what is known and what still needs checking.

`plan` knows the chosen Target and Candidates, so it identifies the capabilities this Run will demand
and applies the selected Endpoint's normal request-support check. Its preflight checks configuration,
credential presence, packages, executables, and relevant Managed Programs without actively probing a
remote service. Read `../production/builds.md` for planning, spending authority, and submission.

## Be honest about the available production

When a capability is unavailable, explain the part of the requested result that depends on it and
the practical choices available. Reference frames, supplied text and product material can still
support interpretation, Script and visual planning. Existing media can support composition with
HyperFrames MG, Caption and Typography when those serve the Brief. Generated performances and
measured speech timing depend on the corresponding capabilities becoming available. Keep the
completed work and the remaining dependency clear so the user can decide how to proceed.
When showing that work, [composition review](../production/review.md#show-what-the-current-work-establishes)
helps distinguish useful intermediate evidence from the intended deliverable.

When the user brings another model, service, or Key, use
[Models and Providers](model-and-provider.md) to distinguish credential setup, Endpoint configuration,
and a package extension. A project can install or author its own Provider or Model through the public
package APIs. The actual service protocol determines whether an existing Provider is reusable.

## Prepare the selected environment

After choosing the services for the next work, use `hypit programs up --endpoint <instance>` to
prepare those helpers, or `hypit runtime up --endpoint <instance>` to start the Worker as well.
Repeat the flag for several instances. Omission deliberately prepares the whole Profile, even when
a capability is bound elsewhere. Preparation follows each Provider's declared dependencies and
Programs; it does not log into remote accounts. `hypit doctor --endpoint <instance>` actively checks
that selected service. `plan` already narrows readiness to the Endpoints resolved for the Run.

Use `local-tools.md` when a selected local binary or Managed Program needs installation or repair.
Read `../production/builds.md` for how submission uses the prepared environment and Worker.
