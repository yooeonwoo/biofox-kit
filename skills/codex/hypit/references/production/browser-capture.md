# Capturing websites and authored HTML

Read this when a real interface, product page or locally authored graphic should become picture
material in the video. `hypit capture` supplies browser capture from the installed Distribution;
the project's scripts describe the actual page interactions.

Choose the material from its role. A screenshot preserves wording and a visible state. A long page
can become a controlled scroll through Media Track's Sampling. A recording preserves interaction
and changing page content when those changes are part of the demonstration. A local HTML file can
produce a static card or graphic. [Graphic composition](../playbooks/craft/graphic-compositions.md)
explains when editable component state is useful, and
[compositing](../playbooks/craft/compositing.md) explains the screen's place in the frame.

## Save a page or region

```bash
hypit capture screenshot https://example.com/product \
  --viewport 540x960 --scale 2 --full-page --to assets/product-page.png

hypit capture screenshot https://example.com/product \
  --selector '#comparison' --to assets/comparison.png

hypit capture screenshot ./assets/card.html \
  --viewport 1080x300 --transparent --to assets/card.png
```

Use `--clip x,y,width,height` for a rectangular region in CSS pixels. A selector, clip or full-page
capture chooses a different extent; the default captures the viewport. Viewport and device scale
are separate: 540 × 960 at scale 2 produces a 1080 × 1920 viewport image. They are task choices;
Puppeteer's device emulation is available in a script when mobile behavior or a user agent matters.

The command waits for page load. `--wait-for <selector>` waits for a visible element, and `--wait-ms`
adds a chosen delay. If content loads through scrolling or interaction, express that in a script.
Watch the saved image to see whether it contains the intended evidence and is readable in its
destination Frame.

## Use ordinary page interactions

For several captures, lazy loading, an authenticated page or a demonstration, put the actual
interactions in a project `.mjs` file. This script needs no Puppeteer import:

```js
// scripts/capture-product.mjs
export const options = {
  launch: { defaultViewport: { width: 1280, height: 720, deviceScaleFactor: 1 } },
};

export default async ({ page, screenshot, record, args, log }) => {
  const [url, destination] = args;
  await page.goto(url);
  await page.waitForSelector('#comparison', { visible: true });
  await screenshot({ path: 'assets/comparison.png', selector: '#comparison' });

  log('Recording the product interaction');
  const recording = await record({ path: destination, fps: 30 });
  await page.click('#show-example');
  await page.waitForSelector('#example-result', { visible: true });
  await recording.stop();
};
```

```bash
hypit capture run scripts/capture-product.mjs -- \
  https://example.com/product assets/product-demo.mp4
```

The selectors above describe an example page; choose the real controls and meaningful start and end
states of the page being captured. Use normal Puppeteer navigation, locators, input and evaluation
to express the task. `browser` is also available for opening more pages; pass one as the second
argument to `screenshot` or `record` to capture it. Returning finishes open recordings and closes
the browser. Completed captures survive a later script failure.

For a scrolling demonstration, identify the container that actually scrolls; a gallery may move
inside a fixed page. Frame the useful content at its intended viewing size and record from a useful
start state through the action. Compare separated saved frames to confirm that the intended rows or
states change. Crop and presentation can then be revised around this recording without repeating
the capture. An authored diagram or simulated interaction whose motion must follow Script events
belongs in an editable component; a recording supplies the real interface behavior being shown.

For local inputs beside the script, `new URL('../assets/card.html', import.meta.url).href` locates
the file. Relative output paths follow the directory where the command runs. `args` contains the
arguments after `--`; use `log` for progress. `--json` reports every completed helper output with its
path and actual dimensions, plus recorded duration and frame rate. Output paths must be new.

## Browser and recording choices

Use an installed compatible browser or prepare the package's tested browser once with
`hypit capture install-browser`. Installation uses Puppeteer's browser cache and leaves existing
browsers in place. [Network preparation](../environment/local-tools.md#make-network-preparation-practical)
explains diagnosing a slow download. `--channel chrome` selects an installed Chrome;
`--browser <executable>` selects another explicit compatible path. `--headed` opens a visible
window. The script's `options.launch` accepts ordinary Puppeteer launch options, including a chosen
`userDataDir` when a dedicated persistent browser profile is useful. CLI browser options override
the script's choices. `--timeout-ms` sets page operation and navigation timeouts.

Native page recordings require Chrome 153 or later, supplied by `install-browser`. They produce MP4;
use an `.mp4` destination. `record({ path, audio: true })` includes page audio when the demonstration
needs it; the default captures picture only. The browser performs encoding. `ffprobe` on `PATH`
reads the saved file's actual dimensions and duration; `options.ffprobePath` can select another
executable. `record` accepts Puppeteer's `RecordOptions`, including `fps` / `frameRate` as a maximum
capture rate and `maxWidth` / `maxHeight` for output dimensions. Music, narration and effects added
in the edit remain ordinary authored audio layers. The helper sets maximum dimensions from the
viewport's device-pixel dimensions; Chrome determines the recorded size. Device scale can enlarge
a screenshot without enlarging the recording. Use the saved video's reported dimensions when
placing it in the composition.

## Place the captured material

Keep captures in project assets and record the source page and its purpose in the project notes.
An image enters through `media:Image`; a recording enters through `media:Video` and the ordinary
[normalization path](media.md). Place them with
[Media Track](tracks.md#coverage-has-a-window-and-a-separate-playback-choice) and the Script's
Selections or Moments as appropriate. Their visibility, crop, scroll and transitions belong to the
composition, so those changes can reuse the captured file.
